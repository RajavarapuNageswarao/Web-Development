        <b>A paragraph</b> is a collection of words strung together to make a
        longer unit than a sentence. Several sentences often make a paragraph.
        There are normally three to eight sentences in a paragraph.

          line and then starting over.</dfn

        This makes it simpler to tell when one paragraph ends and the next
        starts simply it has 3-9 lines. A topic phrase appears in most ordered
        types of writing, such as essays. This paragraph's topic sentence
        informs the reader about the topic of the paragraph. In most essays,
        numerous paragraphs make statements to support a thesis statement, which
        is the essay's fundamental point. Paragraphs may signal when the writer
        changes topics. Each paragraph may have a number of sentences, depending
        on the topic. if want more story go to This
